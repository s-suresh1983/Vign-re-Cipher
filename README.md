# Vignère Cipher
 Like the Caesar cipher, the Vignère cipher is a simple substitution algorithm, that means, each letter is replaced by another letter. In the Caesar cipher, each letter is shifted the same number of times. And this number is the key. In Vignère these number of shifts change from letter to letter. The number of shifts are given by a keyword which is repeated until it matches the length of the text to be encrypted.
